 There were a couple other players out due to injury according to the

"Unfortunately for Levine and Guy, neither did too much in their first preseason game against the "

It's good to read that rookie 3rd round RB

 showed some promise against the Browns as a decent rusher and a good receiver.
While it's not making the kind of Twitter news that was made from 
 DE 
"'s knee scare, backup OT "
 had knee surgery. From the 
:
"If you're wondering ""who is Chris Campbell"" well he's a little used offensive tackle who was awful last preseason, but somehow stuck on the practice squad all last season. However he is 6-5, 327 lbs., and you can't coach a player to become that big. So it's understandable they've spent a year trying to develop him."
"I had been wondering why he hadn't gotten any playing time in their last preseason game, and now at least my curiosity is satisfied. The bad news is that this injury happened while he's battling for an NFL career. The good news for him is that none of his likely competitors for the backup tackle position got off to a good start against the "

I'm hesitant to write anything about 
 DE 
"'s knee injury because if he returns to practice on Wednesday morning, then it's nothing at all. "
" about a possible MRI scan, but Neal himself seemed to say it wasn't necessary. From "
:
"At practice Tuesday, the defensive end appeared to suffer a potentially serious knee injury. During an individual drill, his left knee buckled and Neal was in pain. He left practice with trainers under his own power. Neal says he'll get a MRI sometime on Wednesday, but that the outcome could be a formality."
"After going through tests with trainers today after practice, Neal believes he sustained no injury whatsoever."
"""It’s nothing,"" Neal said. ""I just fell down. Nothing’s torn at all. I just have a little inflammation. Everybody’s tripping out for no reason. I’m not on crutches or anything. I’m walking perfectly fine."""
"If there is something wrong, here's the potential problem. It looks like the Packers intend to use Neal and DE "
" as their top two interior rushers on passing downs, so his absence might create a problem with their defensive scheme. Neal has more potential as a pass rusher than either C.J. Wilson or Jarius Wynn. And it's doubtful the Packers could find a quality replacement now. "
"But I don't want to make a big deal out of him either. He would barely make it onto my Top 10 most important defensive players list, if I had one. He could make the defense better this season, but he isn't the key to it either."

" with the first team defense in practice, and I'm not surprised to read that he's looking the best in pass rushing drills. While LB "
" had a monster 3 sack game in the final regular season, that was all the pass rush he brought last season. Zombo's been the more consistent performer. More from "
:
"Brad Jones appears set as the top backup on the left side behind Clay Matthews, so it's down to Zombo and Walden on the right side. On one play versus the "
", Zombo overran a play action fake and allowed "
 to roll to his right for an easy completion. Walden didn't look much better in space as TE Ben Watson ran past him in coverage for a 37 yard gain. Both players ended the game with 1 tackle each.
"So far, I'm underwhelmed with what I've seen. I was hoping that 7th round rookie LB "

 might be in the market for the

"). Also, after watching the Seahawks struggle with veteran S Lawyer Malloy in the playoffs, Bigby could actually provide a slight upgrade. If he can stay healthy, of course."
". This isn't current free agent news, but I wouldn't be surprised if Barnett is better than Posluszny. He might even be more reliable by staying healthy. Though Barnett has missed big chunks of the 2008 and 2010 seasons due to injury, Posluszny has only made it through one NFL season for all 16 games. Barnett has played in 15 or 16 games in 6 of his 8 NFL seasons."
". He's not yet a free agent, but I'd be surprised if anyone claimed him off waivers. Via Pro Football Talk is the idea that the "

 LB 
 and Packers LB

He initially discusses the Packers fantasy football potential before moving onto the team's positional concerns. And he finishes it up with a discussion about chili. 
"The state of their run defense isn't a major concern to me. While their awful run defense was a big problem in 2008, they did just fine with a mediocre run defense in 2010. In a pass heavy NFL, with many teams likely to find themselves in a shoot-out against "
", it isn't as important that they're stout against the run. But with fewer injuries on the line, and the addition of DT "
" to provide some needed bulk inside, I expect they'll show some improvement next season."
